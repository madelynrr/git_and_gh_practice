I got to go to Brazil in college, I was very lucky and got to travel all around the country.
I went to Rio, Sao Paulo, Curitiba, and Santarem.
One of the best days was hiking up Corcovado to the Jesus statue in Rio.
I then went to Chile for a few weeks.
I got to try blood sausage, bought from walmart.
